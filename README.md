I was gonna have a cool random quote thing, but you can't run JS on GitHub ;-; (Which makes sense, but still rip)
<script>
function random_quote(){
  let quotes = ['"When in doubt, make it explode!"', '"When life gives you lemons, find the voltage drop across the lemon."', '"GAH HOOOOOOF"', '"Huh. Neat."']
  let number = Math.floor((Math.random() * quotes.length) + 0);
  document.getElementById("random_quote").innerHTML = quotes[number];
}
</script>
